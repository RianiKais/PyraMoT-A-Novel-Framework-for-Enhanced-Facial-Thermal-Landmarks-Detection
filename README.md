# PyraMoT-A-Novel-Framework-for-Enhanced-Facial-Thermal-Landmarks-Detection

Abstractâ€”Facial analysis and recognition are vital components
in many real-world applications, such as driver safety
monitoring, security systems, and healthcare. Despite the need
for thermal images in many of these applications, there has
been limited research conducted on facial landmark recognition
for thermal images. This scarcity can be partly attributed to
a lack of thermal datasets for comprehensive analysis. In this
paper, we make three major contributions to the field of thermal
facial landmark detection. First, we present D5050, a novel
thermal face dataset that includes 166 video sequences and 5050
annotated thermal images from 163 different subjects, which
is, to our knowledge, the largest dataset with comprehensive
landmark annotation in terms of the number of subjects.
Second, we propose PyraMoT, an innovative thermal facial
landmark detection framework that combines a customized
encoder-decoder structure and a Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN) with the efficiency of MobileNetV2 and the incorporation
of the anisotropic loss function. Third, we conduct a thorough
comparative analysis with existing approaches, including six
methods, three datasets, and four color palettes for thermal
facial landmark detection. This study employs measures such
as Normalized Mean Error (NME) and Failure Rate (FR) to
determine and comparatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability
of the various detection methods. Overall, our proposed
approach outperforms other methods on different datasets and
contributes to the field of thermal image processing, proposing
three main advancements that address current limitations in
the field.
